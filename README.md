# Home_Sales
In this project I used my knowledge in SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sale data. Using sparksql, I tried to answer the following questions:

- What is the average price of a four-bedroom house sold each year?
- What is the average price of a home sold each year that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?
- What is the average price of a home sold each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?
- What is the average price of a home per "view" rating that has an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000.

To look at my code, go to the "Starter_code" folder and select the "Home_sales" file.
